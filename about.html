    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>Hailing from the small country of Botswana, Tumisang Swabi is the real deal. Her diamond country has shaped her into the person she is right now. She has attended her school life in the capital city being Gaborone.
        Before relocating to Ghana for a training program, Tumisang worked as a solutions architect and business process administrator in the telecommunications space as she digitalized most telco's internal business 
        processes and worked with other stakeholders to integrate cloud BPO in their business processes. She is currently in a training program in Ghana where she is training on how to be a successful software entrepreneur.
        Tumisang Swabi is an aspiring female entrepreneur who is passionate about fintech, digital transformation and the adoption of STEAM Technology in junior schools. She also has a tech startup which is on a mission to
        disrupt the status quo by primarily focusing on using financial technology, blockchain, big data and AI to improve the standard of living of marginalised individuals in Botswana and Southern Africa. 

        Currently they have 2 softwares in development, one is a web platform that seeks to help freelancers and unemployed youth to advertise their skill sets, get instant job matches based on their profiles and payments
        through mobile money solutions as Botswana's economy do not allow informal sector employees to have financial freedom. Another software is a mobile application integrated with blockchain that is digitizing traditional group
        savings or what we call in Southern Africa as motshelo or stokvel.</p>
